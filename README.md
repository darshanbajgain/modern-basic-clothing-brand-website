## 💡 Development Journey

This project started as a basic template from v0.dev and was extensively customized and enhanced to create a fully functional e-commerce website. Key development milestones included:

1. **Initial Setup**: Started with a basic Next.js template
2. **UI Design**: Implemented clean, minimalist design principles
3. **Product Catalog**: Created a flexible product data structure
4. **Filtering System**: Added category and price filtering capabilities
5. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
6. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented Next.js best practices
