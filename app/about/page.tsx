          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-4">
            MANYUMI was founded in 2019 by a young Nepali entrepreneur with a vision to showcase the beauty of
            traditional Nepali textiles and craftsmanship to the world. Growing up surrounded by the rich textile
            heritage of Nepal, our founder was inspired to create a brand that would honor these traditions while making
            them relevant for the modern consumer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-4">
            What began as a small collection of handwoven scarves has evolved into a comprehensive range of clothing and
            accessories, each piece thoughtfully designed and ethically produced in Nepal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600">
            Today, MANYUMI continues to work directly with local artisans, ensuring fair wages and preserving
            traditional techniques that have been passed down through generations.

            Sustainability is at the core of everything we do. We work with natural, locally-sourced materials and
            traditional, low-impact production methods that have been used in Nepal for centuries.
          </p>
